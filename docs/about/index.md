## Why this project exists

Being an online, multi-language, multi-timezone conference, we face unique and different challenges from other types of events and conferences.
Our organizers are all volunteers from different part of the world.
We have many communications and coordinations with our team of volunteers ahead of the conference, and less during the conference itself.

## Challenges in managing our online conference

ðŸ¤• Our organizing team collaborate with each other to manage our volunteers, our speakers, and our sponsors.
Each team also collaborate with our design and media team to produce promotional assets.
For the last 2 years, we manage a lot of our assets and information using spreadsheets and Google Forms.
However, managing and sharing data with various volunteers using spreadsheets have been challenging, and causing frustrations and confusions among our team of volunteers.

## What we're building: PyLadiesCon Web Portal

ðŸ’» This year, we are developing an online web portal for us to manage the behind the scenes work of our conference.
Instead of spreadsheets, we will be accepting volunteer sign ups and sponsorship sign ups through our web portal.
Our team leads will be assigning task and tracking team progress through the web portal.
We also want to build a conference dashboard to provide overview and statistics about our conference.
