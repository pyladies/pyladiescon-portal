# Contributing Guide

## Where and How to get help

Open an issue in our [repo](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladiescon-portal),
or [start a discussion item](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladiescon-portal/discussions) on GitHub.

## Running Tests

Tests are run using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

To run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

## Test coverage

We aim for 100% test coverage. The coverage report is generated after running the tests, and can be viewed in the `htmlcov` directory.

## Code style and linting

Run ``make reformat`` prior to committing. There is a CI that checks for code style and linting issues.
