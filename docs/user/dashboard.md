Review & act

Scan badges to see state at a glance:

Payment: Paid, Awaiting Payment, Not Paid, Partial

Application: Pending, Approved, Rejected

Payment tracking quick checks

Filter Payment Status = Awaiting Payment to see who needs nudging.

Sort by Amount to Pay (DESC) to prioritize largest obligations.

After recording a payment on the detail page, the row returns as Paid on refresh.

Typical workflows

Triage new applicants: Filter Application Status = Pending → open each → approve/reject.

Chase payments: Filter Payment Status = Not Paid/Awaiting → sort by Amount to Pay → open record → send reminder/mark partial.

Tier review: Filter by Sponsorship Type to see distribution and gaps.

Empty/edge cases

If no results match, you’ll see an empty-state message. Clear filters or adjust search.

Pagination appears when results exceed a page; sorting/filters persist across pages.

Sharing views

The dashboard uses URL query params (e.g., ?q=acme&tier=champion&pay_status=awaiting). Copy the URL to share the exact filtered/sorted view with teammates.
